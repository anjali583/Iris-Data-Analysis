**Iris Dataset Analysis**

**1. Introduction**
**1.1. Background**
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for benchmarking algorithms. It contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica) with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**1.2. Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.
- Build a classification model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features.
- Evaluate the performance of the classification model.

**2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
**2.1. Data Overview**
The dataset consists of 150 instances, with each instance having the following attributes:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
- Species (target variable)

**2.2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
**2.2.1. Descriptive Statistics**
Mean and Standard Deviation: Calculated for each feature.
Class Distribution: The dataset is balanced, with each species having 50 instances.

**2.2.2. Visualizations**
Histograms: Plotted for each feature to visualize the distribution.
- Box Plots: Used to identify outliers and understand the spread of data.
- Pair Plots: Created to visualize relationships between features and how they separate the species.

**3. Model Building**
**3.1. Data Splitting**
The data was split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split.

**3.2. Model Selection**
Several models were considered, including:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model chosen: Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected based on cross-validation results.

**3.3. Feature Scaling**
Features were scaled using StandardScaler to improve the model's performance, particularly for distance-based algorithms like SVM and KNN.

**4. Model Evaluation**
**4.1. Metrics Used**
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Calculated for each class to evaluate the model's performance in more detail.

**4.2. Results**
- Accuracy: The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test set.
- Confusion Matrix: Showed the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class.

**4.3. Visualization**
Decision Boundary: Plotted to visualize how the model distinguishes between different species.

**5. Conclusion**
**5.1. Summary**
The SVM model provided a high level of accuracy in classifying the Iris species. The features petal length and petal width were particularly influential in distinguishing between species.

**5.2. Limitations**
- The dataset is relatively small and balanced, which may not reflect real-world scenarios.
- The model may not generalize well to more complex datasets with overlapping classes.
